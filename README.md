I've created something cool â€“ a project with five clickable thumbnails that look like radio buttons. Inside each thumbnail, there are awesome images. Click on any image, and it magically enlarges for a closer look!

It's a fun way to explore pictures and interact with them. Stay tuned for more updates on my creative journey!
